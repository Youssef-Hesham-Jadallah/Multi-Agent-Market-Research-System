🤖 Meet the AgentsEach agent plays a crucial role in the intelligence gathering pipeline:1. Web Search Agent (agents/web_search_agent.py)Role: The digital explorer.Functionality: Queries specified job platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) to collect raw HTML data. It's built with robust fetching capabilities, dynamic delays to mimic human browsing, and error handling for resilient data acquisition.Status: Implemented for LinkedIn, designed for future expansion to other platforms.2. Data Extraction Agent (agents/data_extraction_agent.py)Role: The intelligent parser.Functionality: Processes the raw HTML data, meticulously extracting structured fields like job title, company, location, and, most importantly, identifying required AI/ML skills from job descriptions using advanced pattern matching.Status: Fully capable of extracting and cleaning core job attributes and skills.3. Trend Analysis Agent (agents/trend_analysis_agent.py)Role: The insight generator.Functionality: Analyzes the cleaned, structured job data to pinpoint the most in-demand job titles, the most frequently required skills, and the geographical distribution of opportunities. It also crafts a concise, natural language summary of the observed market trends.Status: Robustly implemented for comprehensive trend analysis.4. Report Writer Agent (agents/report_writer_agent.py)Role: The professional storyteller.Functionality: Compiles all the gathered insights and analyses into a polished, visually appealing PDF report. This agent integrates high-quality charts generated by the visualizations.py utility, providing a clear and comprehensive overview.Status: Fully implemented to generate professional PDF reports.⚙️ Setup & InstallationGetting this system up and running is straightforward:Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-ai-ml-jobs-mena.git](https://github.com/yourusername/multi-agent-ai-ml-jobs-mena.git)
cd multi-agent-ai-ml-jobs-mena
(Note: Replace yourusername with your actual GitHub username if you're hosting this project.)Create a virtual environment (🌟 Highly Recommended 🌟):python -m venv venv
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:

Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
▶️ UsageTo unleash the power of the multi-agent system and generate your market intelligence report:python main.py
Upon successful execution, you will find:The final PDF report, top_ai_ml_jobs_mena_may_2025.pdf, in the reports/ directory.Accompanying charts (top_titles.png, top_skills.png) also in reports/.Raw and processed job data stored in the data/ directory for review or re-analysis.🗄️ Data Storage (data/ folder)The data/ folder is automatically created and managed by the main.py script. It serves as a crucial temporary storage for:raw_jobs_data.json: Contains the raw, unadulterated job postings collected directly from the web scraping phase.processed_jobs_data.json: Stores the structured and cleaned job entries after the data extraction phase, making them ready for sophisticated trend analysis.💡 Tip: These files are invaluable for debugging and allow you to re-run analysis or report generation without needing to re-scrape the web, saving time and resources.🔮 Future EnhancementsWe envision several exciting enhancements to further empower this system:🌐 Expanded Platform Support: Integrate additional prominent job platforms in the MENA region (e.g., Bayt, Wuzzuf, Glassdoor) for broader data coverage.🧠 Advanced Parsing: Develop more robust and adaptive parsing rules to gracefully handle diverse website structures and dynamic content.💰 Salary Estimation: Incorporate modules for extracting and estimating salary ranges, if such reliable data becomes available from job postings.📈 Interactive Dashboard/CLI: Implement a dynamic command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web dashboard for real-time preview of trends and insights.✨ Sophisticated NLP for Skills: Utilize cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) models for highly accurate and nuanced skill extraction, including identifying skill synonyms and variations.⏳ Temporal Trend Analysis: Extend the Trend Analysis Agent to identify shifts and evolving patterns in job demand and skill requirements over time.📜 LicenseThis project is open-sourced under the MIT License.
